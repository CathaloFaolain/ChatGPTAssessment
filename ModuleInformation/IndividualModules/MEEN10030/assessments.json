{"Description":{"0":"Lab Report: Based on two laboratory experiments that all students are expected to complete, while working in pairs, and collaborating with other pairs. Each lab is weighted equally.","1":"Examination: An end of trimester online MCQ examination will assess each student's overall understanding of the module. Resit students will be assessed wholly on the basis of this written examination.","2":"Group Project: Groups of students (approximately 5 per group) will be required to collaborate on an assignment that is intended to allow students to demonstrate their understanding of key concepts of this module.","3":"Class Test: In-class MCQ tests will be set randomly throughout the trimester, without announcement, to provide students with formative feedback on their understanding of course material."},"Timing":{"0":"Varies over the Trimester","1":"2 hour End of Trimester Exam","2":"Varies over the Trimester","3":"Throughout the Trimester"},"Open Book Exam":{"0":null,"1":"No","2":null,"3":null},"Component Scale":{"0":"Alternative linear conversion grade scale 40%","1":"Alternative linear conversion grade scale 40%","2":"Alternative linear conversion grade scale 40%","3":"Graded"},"Must Pass Component":{"0":"No","1":"No","2":"No","3":"No"},"% of Final Grade":{"0":20,"1":60,"2":20,"3":0},"Assessment Type":{"0":"Lab Report","1":"Examination","2":"Group Project","3":"Class Test"},"Module Code":{"0":"MEEN10030","1":"MEEN10030","2":"MEEN10030","3":"MEEN10030"},"Scaled % of Final Grade":{"0":20.0,"1":60.0,"2":20.0,"3":0.0},"Work Type":{"0":"Hybrid","1":"In person","2":"Hybrid","3":"In person"},"Level":{"0":"1 (Introductory)","1":"1 (Introductory)","2":"1 (Introductory)","3":"1 (Introductory)"},"Credits":{"0":5.0,"1":5.0,"2":5.0,"3":5.0},"School":{"0":"Mechanical & Materials Eng","1":"Mechanical & Materials Eng","2":"Mechanical & Materials Eng","3":"Mechanical & Materials Eng"},"Module Coordinator":{"0":"Professor Michael Gilchrist","1":"Professor Michael Gilchrist","2":"Professor Michael Gilchrist","3":"Professor Michael Gilchrist"},"Semester":{"0":"Spring","1":"Spring","2":"Spring","3":"Spring"},"Enrolled Students 22\/23":{"0":298,"1":298,"2":298,"3":298},"Stage":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null}}
